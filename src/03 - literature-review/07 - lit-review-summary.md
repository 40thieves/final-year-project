#### 2.3 Chapter Summary

The previous chapter introduced the concepts of altmetrics, which is the basis for the goals of this project. The project will provide tools for altmetrics practitioners studying how altmetrics change over time.

In this chapter, a more detailed view of altmetrics was given, putting them in context by giving the history of bibliometrics (see section 2.1). Definitions of altmetrics were given in section 2.2, along with a break down of commonly used altmetrics data sources giving their characteristics. Arguments for and against altmetrics were examined in sections 2.3 and 2.4 respectively. Finally, section 2.5 concluded that altmetrics provide a powerful and flexible tool for measuring scholarly impact. Potential future work in the altmetrics field was also discussed, giving more detail on why the goals of the project were chosen.

Chapter 3 presents the design of the application that will attempt to solve the problems discussed in this chapter. The design is crucial to ensuring that the goals of the project are met.
