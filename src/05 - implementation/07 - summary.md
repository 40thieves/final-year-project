#### 4.7 Summary

This chapter describes the implementation of an application to examine how altmetrics change over time, which is based on the design discussed in Chapter 3. Implementation of the altmetrics data collection API wrapper is described in section 4.2, and the search API wrapper is described in section 4.3. The application's visualisation and storage implementations were discussed in sections 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. Finally, implementation details of the web application were described in section 4.6.

Chapter 5 will look at testing performed on the application, and the results of these tests. In addition, the final application will be evaluated against the project's requirements. Implementation details discussed in this chapter will have a sizeable effect on the outcome of this evaluation.
