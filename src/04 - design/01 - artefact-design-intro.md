### Chapter 3 Artefact Design

#### 3.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter it was identified that altmetrics are a new approach to the field of measuring scientific impact, using an array of web-based services to discover impact. Altmetrics were found to be an alternative to traditional forms of impact measurement, such as the impact factor, improving the speed, diversity and - in some cases - accuracy of impact measurements. It was found that there is little study of how altmetrics change over time, and tools are required for this analysis.

In this chapter, the design of a system for visualising how altmetric data sources change over time will be discussed. The first section will describe the project's design methodology (section 3.2), and then the system's requirement's will be discussed (section 3.3). Finally, a solution is proposed in section 3.4.
