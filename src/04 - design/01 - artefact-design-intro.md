* Identified that:
	* Altmetrics are good for improving the speed, diversity and accuracy of impact measurements
	* Little or no research into how altmetrics change over time
		* Tools are required
			* Lots of data to analyse
			* Better to visulise
			* Altmetrics emphasise the qualitative assessment of impact, not just quantitative
		* A tool that visualises how altmetric data sources change over time
	* Tools for collating data already exist
		* ImpactStory, PLOS ALM
		* Difficult to track accurately
			* Especially with historical data
		* Provide APIs
	* Transparency is good for altmetrics
		* Open source
