#### 1.2 Project Goals

In the previous section, an introduction to altmetrics was given, and it was found that altmetrics is a powerful new tool for measuring impact. An area of future work was highlighted that is of interest to the project, as it has the potential to add greatly to the field of altmetrics. This area is the study of how altmetrics changes over a period of time. For this research to begin, tools for the analysis of complex and voluminous data that altmetrics produces must be created. This is the main goal of the project; to create a tool, or set of tools, that will assist altmetrics researchers in studying how altmetrics changes over time. It is believed that if these tools are provided, researchers will be encouraged to start studying this area, potentially using these tools in their work.

A secondary goal of the project is to make the tools produced by the project usable by a wider group of users. Traditionally, scientific software does not have a reputation for good usability and striking design aesthetic. This turns users away, especially those outside of the altmetrics research community. As described in the previous section, altmetrics is aimed at a wider section of society, meaning that more casual users may encounter the application. For this reason, the project will aim to make the artefact as usable as possible to these casual users. By improving accessibility of altmetrics tools, it is believed that more people will use altmetrics to gain insight into their own impact.

Finally, this project aims to experiment with new technologies to investigate the best choices for the application. The software world is constantly evolving and changing to produce new concepts or improvements on older ideas. Sometimes these succeed, and become widely adopted, however this is not always the case. Some technologies are particularly well suited to given circumstances. Assessments on the technologies used must be made to evaluate whether they are the right choice for the current situation.
