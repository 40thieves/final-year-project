### 1.3 Overview of Report

This section will give a chapter-by-chapter overview of what is contained in this report. Summaries of the content of the chapter will be given for each.

Chapter 2 reviews the published literature on altmetrics, giving details on the history of bibliometrics, criticism of traditional metrics, including the impact factor, a breakdown of what altmetrics are, and evidence to support the usage of altmetrics. Criticism of altmetrics is then discussed and counter-arguments made. Finally, conclusions of the review are drawn and potential future work is detailed.

In Chapter 3 the design of the artefact is discussed. The methodology that is used throughout the project is described, followed by the list of requirements needed to achieve the goals stated in section 1.2. Finally, a proposed solution to the problem described by the requirements is detailed in section 3.4.

Chapter 4 describes the implementation of the application. Key aspects of the 5 major parts that make up the application are discussed in more detail. Problems that were encountered during this phase of the project are described and the solutions and work-arounds to these issues are given.

Chapter 5 discusses the tests that were performed on the final application and gives an overview of their results. These results are then used in section 5.3 to evaluate the artefact. As part of this the requirements given in section 3.3 are assessed and the artefact evaluated against them. Finally for this chapter, the implementation details described in chapter 4 are evaluated.

Finally, chapter 6 draws conclusions on the project. A brief summary of the report is given, before a synopsis of the final artefact. Finally, key points of the conclusion are described, along with possible future work.
