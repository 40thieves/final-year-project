### Abstract

Altmetrics are a faster, more diverse and transparent form of bibliometrics. Altmetrics use web-based sources of information, such as social networks, to find citations of academic work which are used capture a novel perspective on the "story" of impact. One aspect of this story that has not been studied in detail is how altmetrics change over a period of time, so this project aims to provide tools for researchers investigating this area. A visualisation is created showing altmetrics data and its change over time. This visualisation is developed as part of a web application that uses several new technologies, including Node.js, D3.js and MongoDB. These technologies were experimented with throughout the project, and assessed for their suitability. The design and implementation of the application is described in this report, discussing the problems encountered and solutions given. A description of the methods used to test the application are given, and these are used to evaluate the artefact. Finally, conclusions about the project are drawn, finding that the application mostly meets the project goals and discusses the areas where more work is necessary.
