### Abstract

Altmetrics provide a new method for measuring scholarly impact that is potentially faster, more diverse and transparent than traditional forms of bibliometrics. Altmetrics use web-based sources of information, such as social networks, to find citations of academic work. These forms of reuse offer the potential to capture a novel perspective on the "story" of impact. One aspect of this story that has not been studied in detail is how altmetrics change over a period of time. This project aims to provide tools for researchers investigating this area, and for those interested in their own scholarly impact. Altmetrics data can be large and complex, making it difficult to analyse without losing some valuable context. The application developed for this project attempts to solve this problem by creating a visualisation of this data and its change over time.

This visualisation is developed as part of a web application that uses several new technologies. Node.js, D3.js and MongoDB are examples of these technologies. These technologies were experimented with throughout the project, and assessed for their suitability.

The design and implementation of the application is described in this report, discussing the problems encountered and solutions given. A description of the methods used to test the application are given, and these are used to evaluate the artefact. Finally, conclusions about the project are drawn, finding that the application mostly meets the project goals and discusses the areas where more work is necessary.
