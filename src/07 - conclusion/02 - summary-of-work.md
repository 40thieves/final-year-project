#### 6.2 Summary

Chapter 1 introduced the topic of altmetrics, briefly explaining the background and arguing the case for altmetrics. The chapter went on to discuss the lack of research into how altmetrics change over time.

Chapter 2 reviewed the altmetrics literature, discussing the history of bibliometrics and the criticism of the impact factor. A more detailed description of what altmetrics are was also given in this chapter. Evidence supporting altmetrics and disputing the relevance of altmetrics was then examined in more detail. Finally, conclusions were drawn on the altmetrics literature, again finding that altmetrics are useful, but more research is required in studying how altmetrics change over time. The project therefore must provide a tool for these researchers to investigate this.

Chapter 3 describes the design of the application. A project methodology was given, describing how project work will be completed. The project's requirements are then listed, describing the necessary functions required to create a successful solution to the problem. A solution is then proposed for these requirements, describing an web application that will provide tools to altmetrics researchers studying how altmetrics change over time.

Chapter 4 describes the implementation of the application in detail. Key aspects of the data collection and search API wrappers, the visualisation, the storage of data and web application parts of the application are discussed. Choices made during the implementation were explained, and solutions to issues raised discussed.

Finally, chapter 5 describes the tests performed on the application, and evaluates the results of these tests. An evaluation of each of the requirements is then done. Finally in this chapter, the final artefact is reviewed and evaluated.
